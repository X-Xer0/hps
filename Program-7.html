<p><b><center><Font color="White" size=5 face="COMIC SANS MS">Always do it on my own so I gotta get through it, And the only thing I know is to love what I'm doing<BR>
Never give up, never slow till I finally prove it, Never listen to the no's, I just wanna keep moving<BR>
<BR>
Keep my head up when I act, Head up, that's a fact<BR>
Never looking back, I'ma keep myself on track, Keep my head up, staying strong<BR>
Always moving on, Feel I don't belong, tell my thoughts to move along<BR>
Push myself to be the best, Die with no regrets<BR>
Live with every breath, see my message start to spread<BR>
And I had so many dreams, Then you hit your teens life<BR>
Ain't really what it seems, try to find out what it means<BR>
<BR>
Always do it on my own so I gotta get through it, And the only thing I know is to love what I'm doing<BR>
Never give up, never slow till I finally prove it, Never listen to the no's, I just wanna keep moving<BR>
Yeah, I put out all this art, it's my only medicine, yeah, Everything I do, I'm just being genuine, yeah<BR>
I'm sick of being screwed, feel my own adrenaline, yeah, I do just what I do and I hope you let me in, let me in, yeah<BR>
<BR>
I'm grateful, oh, yeah, Able, oh, yeah<BR>
I'm stable, oh, yeah, No label, oh, yeah<BR>
You know me, I have, Only a path<BR>
I'm lonely, but damn, I'm going to win, yeah</b></Font><BR></p>
