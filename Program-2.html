<Font size=5 face="Times New Roman"><b>Coronavirus disease <i>(COVID-19)</b></i> is an infectious disease caused by a newly <br>
discovered coronavirus.<br>

Most people infected with the <i>COVID-19 virus</i> will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness<br>
and recover without requiring special treatment.<br>
The size of the virus is between <mark><EM>5×10<SUP>-8</SUP> to 20×10<SUP>-8</SUP>.</EM></mark><br><br>
Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like <mark><i>diabetes,<br>
chronic respiratory disease, and cancer</i></mark> are more likely to develop serious illness.<br>
<BR>

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the <i>COVID-19 virus</i>,<br>
the disease it causes and how it spreads.<br>
Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an <i>alcohol based<br>
rub</i> frequently and not touching your face.<br>
<BR>

The <i>COVID-19 virus</i> spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose<br>
when an infected person coughs or sneezes.<br>
So its important that you also practice respiratory etiquette.<br>
