<p><b>Computer programming</b> is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task.<br>
The <b>source code</b> of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code,<br>
which is directly executed by the central processing unit.</p><br>

<p>Some most popular Programming languages are- <mark><b>Java</b>, Python</b>, <b>C++</b>, <b>PHP etc.<br></mark>
Many people have a misconception that <b>HTML</b> is a programming language. <b>HTML</b> is not a programming language, but is a Markup language.<br>
The things we can create by using <b>HTML</b> are- Webpages, Webdocument, Client-side storage and much more.</p><br>

Programming is very interesting and quiet tough, but if you have keen interest in it then you are not very far from building your own software.<br>
That is it for today guys, see you soon in my next webpage.<br><br>
